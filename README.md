# pi2mqtt

This tool monitors sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi and sends the data to a
broker via mqtt protocol.  The current sensors include:
## Temp - Thermistor
You can connect multiple thermistors to an A/D card connected to the Raspberry Pi.  The typical circuit is to have the NTN Thermistor connected to an analog input with a pull down resistor to ground and the Thermistor connected to the pin and to Vdd.  

To enable, the implementation that was validated uses a ADS1115 A/D card attached to the Pi.
## Temp -  DS18B20
You can connect multiple DS18B20 sensors to pin 4 of the rpi.  Be sure to include 
a 4.7Kohm pull up.  The tools will scan for devices in the `/sys/bus/w1/devices` directory.  DS18B20 devices will have the prefix of _28-\*_.
	
For the sensor kernel module to be enabled, include the following line in the `/boot/config.txt` file
```
	dtoverlay=w1-gpio
```
Edit the file and include the above line, then reboot, and the device should be visible
## Electric Demand - RAVEn
The **Rainforest RAVEn** device connect to the USB port on the rpi and can be used 
to read a smart electric meter in the home.  Currently, this works with San Diego Gas and Electric Meters to the best of the authors knowledge.
## Door Switch
This can be any digital signal on a pin that is either high or low.  Currently used for a magnetic Reed switch on a door.  The tool reads the digital pin using the **wiringPi** package numbering scheme.  You will need to add the pin number to your configuration file.
##Usage
```
    $ pi2mqtt [-v] [-c FILE]
    -v - verbose mode.
    -c - configuration file (default is template.conf)
```
###MQTT Remote Control
The ability to control the device remotely is available by publishing commands to the manage topic of the device. The commands are in the form of the topic and some commands will use the message data as well.  Below is a list of the commands available
* -t <device management topic>/reboot   Reboots the system
* -t <device management topic>/kill     Terminates the pi2mqtt on the remote system
* -t <device management topic>/read     Start an out of cycle read of all data from the pi
* -t <device management topic>/update   Will update the config file with the file passed as the message.

##Installation
To build and install the tools you will need to install the autotools suite.  For ubuntu:
```
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install autotools-dev
```
**pi2mqtt** depends on the following libraries
* [wiringPi](http://wiringpi.com) (http://wiringpi.com)
* [paho-mqtt3](http://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/c) (http://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/c)
* [confuse](https://github.com/martinh/libconfuse) (https://github.com/martinh/libconfuse)


###Installing Using GIT:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ngongca/pi2mqtt.git
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ ./init_pi2mqtt

<Edit the configuration file>

$ make
$ sudo make install
```
Setting up for auto initialization
```
$ sudo cp pi2mqtt.sh /etc/init.d/pi2mqtt
$ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/pi2mqtt
$ sudo update-rc.d pi2mqtt defaults
```
## Configuration
`./init_pi2mqtt` generates a template configuration file, ___pi2mqtt.conf___ , that will need to be edited for your configuration.  It uses the **confuse** libary syntax. Below is the syntax for the various types of sensors.
### Manditory fields
Home topic for all mqtt topics.  In this case it will be an autogenerated ID using the PI Serial number.
```
home = <id>
```
client ID for the mqtt sensor controller (usually the microcontroller id such as the PI  THIS MUST BE A UNIQUE identifier)
```
clientid = <id>
```
mqtt broker address
```
mqttbrokeraddress = "<address>"
```
mqtt broker user id if the broker requires a user authentication
```
mqttbrokeruid = "<user id>"
```
mqtt broker user id password
```
mqttbrokerpwd = "<password>"
```
topic for the sensor controller's management port. This will be monitored to provide management messages back to the controller.  It is autogenerated to use the PI home topic. see [MQTT Remote Control](#mqtt-remote-control)
```
mqttsubtopic = "<topic>"
```
### Thermistor Temp Sensor syntax
<> indicates user input.  Leading spaces are required. Multiple sensors are allowed as long as there is a unique identifer
```
tempsensor <identifier> {
 pin = "<wiring pi pin for A/D>"
 A = "<Stienman-Hart coefficient>"
 B = "<Stienman-Hart coefficient>"
 C = "<Stienman-Hart coefficient>"
 Rb = "<bias resister value (fp) pulldown to ground>"
 location = "<location of sensor used in topic>"
 mqttpubtopic = "<topic to publish>"
 sampletime = <integer in seconds>
}

Example:

tempsensor nistthermistor1 {
 pin = 2
 A = "1.413e-03"
 B = "2.385e-04"
 C = "9.588e-08"
 Rb = 0.0
 location = "freezer1"
 mqttpubtopic = "tempsensor"
 sampletime = 60
}

```
### DS18B20 config syntax
<> indicates user input.  Leading spaces are required
```
ds18b20 <identifier> {
 address = "<fully qualified directory to device>"
 mqttpubtopic = "<topic to publish>"
 sampletime = <integer in seconds>
 isfahrenheit = <1 if is, 0 if Celsius desired>
}

Example:

ds18b20 ds18b20_0 {
 address = "/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-0516a49946ff"
 mqttpubtopic = "temp"
 location = "server"
 sampletime = 4
 isfahrenheit = 1
}
```
### Switch config syntax
<> indicates user input.  Leading spaces are required
```
doorswitch <identifier> {
 pin = <wiringPi pin number>
 mqttpubtopic = "<topic to publish>"
 location = "<string location of sensor (no spaces)>"
 sampletime = <time in seconds>
 samplecontinuous = <0 to report state change only, 1 to report every sampletime>
}

Example:

doorswitch door1 {
 pin = 1
 mqttpubtopic = "door"
 location = "garageleft"
 sampletime = 10
 samplecontinuous = 1
}
```
### RAVEn config syntax 
<> indicates user input.  Leading spaces are required
```
RAVEn <identifier> {
 address = "<location of the serial port>"
 location = "<text>"
 mqttpubtopic = "<topic to publish>"
}

Example:

RAVEn raven0 {
 address = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
 location = "garage"
 mqttpubtopic = "demand"
}

```
