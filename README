pi2mqtt

This tool monitors sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi. It then sends that
data via mqtt to a broker indicated in the configuration file.  The current
broker is hard coded with username piiot and password mqttpi.  The current
sensors include:

Temp -  DS18B20
	You can connect multiple DS18B20 sensors to pin 4 of the rpi.  Be sure
	to include a 4.7Kohm pull up.  The tools will scan for devices in the
	/sys/bus/w1/devices directory.  DS18B20 devices will have the prefix 
        of 28-*.
	
	For the sensor kernel module to be enabled, include the following line
	in the /boot/config.txt file
	dtoverlay=w1-gpio

	Edit the file and include the above line, then reboot, and the device 
	should be visible

Electric Demand - RAVEn
	The Rainfores RAVEn device connect to the USB port on the rpi and can
	be used to read a smart electric meter in the home.  Currently, this
	works with San Diego Gas and Electric Meters (to the best of the 
	authors knowledge.

Using GIT:

-----------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/ngongca/pi2mqtt.git
cd pi2mqtt
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
sudo make install
./init_pi2mqtt
------------------------------------------------

You should then edit the template.conf file.
